# BANKING_APPLICATION_ASSIGNMENT
The bank application using python would allow users to create a new bank account, deposit funds into their account, withdraw funds from their account, and view their current balance.

To create a new bank account, the user would input their personal information such as their name, address, and social security number. The application would then generate a unique account number and create a new account for the user.

To deposit funds, the user would enter the amount they wish to deposit and the application would add it to their account balance.

To withdraw funds, the user would enter the amount they wish to withdraw and the application would subtract it from their account balance. If the user tries to withdraw more money than they have available in their account, the application would display an error message.

To view their current balance, the user would simply request to view their balance and the application would display the current amount in their account.

Overall, this bank application using python would provide users with a convenient way to manage their financial accounts and transactions.
